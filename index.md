# Knowledgebase

Welcome to my knowledgebase site!

My Name is David.

I live in Bavaria, Germany.

This is my knowledgebase project for technical and programming topics. The articles are about C#, .NET, SQL and other topics for learning and practicing.

I work as a software developer in the chemical industry. Before that I studied computer science at TH Rosenheim and worked as an administrator / ERP system developer and as an IT consultant. 
My hobbies include technology, reading fantasy and science fiction books, weightlifting, archery and games.
