# Knowledgebase

Welcome to my knowledgebase site!

My Name is David.

[![David Bow](/assets/images/David_Halletz.png)](/assets/images/David_Halletz.png)

I live in Bavaria, Germany.

This is my knowledgebase project for technical and programming topics. The articles are about C#, .NET, SQL and other topics for learning and practicing.

I currently work as a software developer in the chemical industry and studied computer science at the TH Rosenheim. Before that I worked as an administrator / ERP system developer and as an IT consultant. My hobbies include technology, reading fantasy and science fiction books, weightlifting, archery and gaming.

You can contact me with [david.halletz@posteo.de](mail-to:david.halletz@posteo.de) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-halletz/).
